## Summary
<p align="justify">
Risk is not something which comes from knowing what you're doing but is a function of how poorly a strategy will perform if the <i>'wrong scenario'</i> occurs. Use a risk assessment to help choose the appropriate sustainable software concepts for your project. 
Too little and your software is unsustainable; 
It can take just a few seconds but gets you off on the right foot.
We all use risk assessments all the time. 
Sometimes they’re formal procedures to ensure an activity is safe, but most of the time they’re the thought of a moment- Is this coffee too hot? Is there a bus coming? 
Software is no different, and using a risk assessment approach like the one described below can really help make your work successful and sustainable.

  In order to make sure a successful project, you need to have <b>Risk-Free</b> softwares to eradicate the impacts of failures and improve project performance. Mananging and assessing risk is different from managing strategy. More or less, it focuses on the negative threats and failures rather than opportunities and success, and hence <b><i>"The Key to risk assessment is never putting yourself in a position where you cannot live to fight another day."</i></b> In pursuance to manage risks we need to realize and understand the scope and objectives of the software and use an appropriate automated risk management tool. With the sole purpose of increasing the feasibility of project accomplishing triumphant conclusion, the risks or potential problems for a project needs to be prospected and prevented at an outset stage and an apprpriate countermeasures developed.

  Briefly summarizing, <i>" If you don't actively attack the risks, the risk will attack you"</i>. With the primary influence of controlling risks proactively, we will shortly  take you on the journey of <b><i>"Risk Assesment: from Prospection to Prevention"</i></b>. This journey will guide you how to identify the risks and how to manage it accordingly by assessing its impact. The last section of this tour will take you to the terminating step which is <i>"Risk Mitigation"</i>,one of our primary goal, which explains you how to get rid of the risks and reduce the uncertainity of failures. During the course of the journey, it describes how risk assessment identifies,analyzes,plans,tracks, controls and organises the risks to minimize the failures and maximize the risk-free outputs.

<p align="justify">
At last we are going to present some case studies which will make you understand various scenarios and situations where you actually needs risk assessment. These case studies will succour you to get more clarifications about the significance of <b><i>"Risk Assessment"</i></b>. It also describes how every single piece of software needs sustainability and how these  requirements can be varied over time. Higher you use the quality software, higher will be the risks and for that <i>Risk Assessment</i> comes up with the efficient approach to keep a balance betweem the two.

To put it in a nutshell, ***"Risk Assessement is vital for your project to keep it safe, protective and Risk-free!!!"***

## How this will help you / why this is useful
Risk assessment is so necessary as it not only identifies and determines the risk, which can cause loss or failure to the project but also helps you to have the prior knowledge of the level of risks and its consequences aftermath.  Its Significance lies in aiding you to deal with the risks and providing you the protective layer against the threats and vulnerability of system's security as well. Making long story short, benefits of risk assessment can be laid down as:

* Enables quantification of risks
* Helps detecting major risks situations
* Prioritizes the risks according to the severity of exposures
* Helps to combat risk apprehensions
* Inspires the developers by enhancing risk awareness
* Lastly, minimizes the loss or failures to the project
* Preeminently, improves the project performance

All of these benefits will enable you to have your final target of achieving risk-free project. Keeping in mind to maintain the balance between the quality of the software and the possibilities of risks, *Risk Assessment* is insisting you to come with us on the trip of ***"Risk Assessment: from Prospection to Prevention"***.

Don't be late as ***"Better three hours too soon than a minute too late"*** and enjoy the wonderful tour with us!!!
