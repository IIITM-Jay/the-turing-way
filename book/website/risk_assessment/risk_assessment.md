## Summary
Use a risk assessment to help choose the appropriate sustainable software concepts for your project. Too little and your software is unsustainable; too much and you wonâ€™t be able to Get On With It. It can take just a few seconds, but gets you off on the right foot.
Risk assessment is one of the broader areas of Risk Management which constitutes of :
* Risk Identifiction
* Risk Analysis
* Risk Prioritization

as its sub-parts. All the above three classifications are equally important as each one of them depends on each other. 
1. __Risk Identification__ is a technique to detect the path where the possibilities of risks and faults are likely to occur.
Once the risk has been identified, then only you can proceed further with the rest of the processes as without first identifying the risks you cannot go with the analysis of it.

2. __Risk Analysis__: After the risk has been identified, it is very important to analyze before it will create any types of major issues on your project. Risk Analysis is a process of determining the consequences and meanwhile estimating the level or the extent of the risk.

3. __Risk Prioritization__ is a methodology to interpret the impacts of the encountered risks and prioritize it accordingly on the basis of the level of damage the risk could make.

The main goal of Risk Assessment is to reduce the uncertainity of the risks and to eradicate it completely. 
The significant approach for doing this is to find the root cause which is reponsible for troubling down to risk, which are generally the bugs, errors and loop holes in the software. 
The next step which is to be followed is to calculate the percentage error followed by prioritization.
Risk Assesssment builds a platform to deal with all these and enables you to work on the project efficiently.


***Risk Assessment of the software is thus vital for your project to keep it safe, protective and risk free!!*** 

## How this will help you / why this is useful
Risk assessment is so necessary as it not only identifies and determines the risk, which can cause loss or failure of the project but also helps you to have the prior knowledge of the level of risks and its consequences afterwards.  
Its Significance is not only limited to identify and detect risks, but also  to deal with it, providing you the protective layer against the threats and vulnerability of system's security as well.
The key point is that it tracks down the risk, implying that it dig outs the appropriate path where  the flaw actually occurs which makes the process of analysing and evaluating easier and more faster.
Another important benefit to use risk assessment in choosing sustainable and appropriate software is that it uses risk prioritization technique under which it determines which risks will have the most potential impact on the project. This can even help in determining the extent to which the uncertainty of a risk may affect the outcome of a project in relation to the uncertainty of all other risks.
