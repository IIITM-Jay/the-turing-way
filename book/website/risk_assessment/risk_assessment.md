Risk assessment in software development is a process that allows possible errors and overall risk in a project be assessed.
Risk in a project is an event that can impact the overall outcome by deviating from planned goals. 
Risk assessment allows us to evaluate the software design or project strategy and assess its performance if an unexpected scenario and errors occur. 
We recommend using a risk assessment approach to help choose the appropriate sustainable software concepts for your project. 
Too little and your software is unsustainable; 
It can take just a few seconds but gets you off on the right foot.
We all use risk assessments all the time. 
Sometimes they’re formal procedures to ensure an activity is safe, but most of the time they’re the thought of a moment- Is this coffee too hot? Is there a bus coming? 
Software is no different, and using a risk assessment approach like the one described below can really help make your work successful and sustainable. Risk assessment in software development can be explored through the classic risk definitions of a broader field of Risk Management that includes the following processes:

* Risk Identification
* Risk Analysis
* Risk Assessment
* Risk Prioritization
* Risk Mitigation 

In the context of software development, these processes of risk management can be defined as follows:
1. __Risk Identification__: This is a process of determining the risks and the pathways for errors that are likely to prevent the software, program or project from performing as planned.
2. __Risk Analysis__: Risk Analysis occurs after the risk identification process of analysing each instance of risk, its consequences and the impact on the performance of the software or projects.
3. __Risk Assessment / Risk Impact Assessment__: Based on the performance analysis, the process of risk impact assessment creates an understanding of the overall consequence of the risks and if they are acceptable.
4. __Risk Prioritization__:  The risk prioritization process helps in prioritizing tasks and allocating resources based on the level of damage the risk could make.
Risks that can cause significant risk by negatively impacting the project's performance, timeline or cost are prioritised for their mitigation plans.
5. __Risk Mitigation__: This process helps in identifying actions or decisions that can reduce the likelihood of occurrence and negative impact of each risk event.
As one of the central processes in Risk Management, the main goals of Risk Assessment is to reduce the uncertainty of the risks and when possible, eradicate it completely.

 In order to ensure the success of your project, you need to design your software that is if not totally *risk-free*, is tested for possible scenarios where it can fail and can handle the impact of those failures on the overall performance.
 In pursuance to manage risks, we need to realize and understand the scope and objectives of the software and use an appropriate automated risk management tool. 
 With the purpose of increasing the feasibility of project accomplishing its expected result without threatening the overall success, the risk assessment steps should guide the investigation of the potential problems in a project and their prevention at an outset stage by developing of appropriate countermeasures.
 
 Briefly summarizing, *" If you don't actively attack the risks, the risk will attack you"*.
 With the primary influence of controlling risks proactively, we will shortly  take you on the journey of ***"Controlling and organizing project risks"***. 
This journey will guide you how to identify the risks and how to manage it accordingly by assessing its impact.
The last section of this tour will take you to the terminating step which is *"Risk Mitigation"*,one of our primary goal, which explains you how to get rid of the risks and reduce the uncertainity of failures.
During the course of the journey, it describes how risk assessment identifies, analyzes, plans, tracks, controls and organises the risks to minimize the failures and maximize the risk-free outputs.
 
At last we are going to present some case studies which will make you understand various scenarios and situations where you actually needs risk assessment.
These case studies will succour you to get more clarifications about the significance of ***"Risk Assessment"***. 
It also describes how every single piece of software needs sustainability and how these  requirements can be varied over time. 
Higher you use the quality software, higher will be the risks and for that *Risk Assessment* comes up with the efficient approach to keep a balance betweem the two.

To put it in a nutshell, ***"Risk Assessement is vital for your project to keep it safe, protective and Risk-free!!!"***

## Benefits of using risk assessment process
Risk assessment is so necessary as it not only identifies and determines the risk, which can cause loss or failure to the project but also helps you to have the prior knowledge of the level of risks and its consequences aftermath.  Its Significance lies in aiding you to deal with the risks and providing you the protective layer against the threats and vulnerability of system's security as well. Making long story short, benefits of risk assessment can be laid down as:

* Enables quantification of risks
* Helps detecting major risks situations
* Prioritizes the risks according to the severity of exposures
* Helps to combat risk apprehensions
* Inspires the developers by enhancing risk awareness
* Lastly, minimizes the loss or failures to the project
* Preeminently, improves the project performance

All of these benefits will enable you to have your final target of achieving risk-free project. Keeping in mind to maintain the balance between the quality of the software and the possibilities of risks, *Risk Assessment* is insisting you to come with us on the trip of ***"Controlling and Organizing project risks "***.

Don't be late as ***"Better three hours too soon than a minute too late"*** and enjoy the wonderful tour with us!!!
